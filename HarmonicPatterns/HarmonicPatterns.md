# Auto Harmonic Patterns Basic [Trendoscope]

Harmonic patterns are powerful technical analysis formations that traders use to identify potential trend reversals and continuation opportunities in financial markets. These patterns are based on specific geometric shapes and Fibonacci ratios, creating a framework for predicting price movements.

The key idea behind harmonic patterns is that price movements exhibit repetitive behavior, allowing traders to anticipate future price action based on historical patterns. However, it's important to note that harmonic patterns are subjective and require careful analysis and confirmation with other technical tools.

## Zigzag
Basic building block for any pattern recognition algorithm is zigzag. This implementation is very basic and relies on single Zigzag Level. Multi level or complex structures can be implemented. However, due to limitations of the platform, it will be difficult to render the patterns on chart. Due to this, will keep it simple in this attempt and let us keep further enhancements to the future whenever the platform is ready.
